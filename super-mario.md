## Overview

Super Mario is a long-running platform game series created by Nintendo and primarily designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. The series stars Nintendo's mascot, Mario, and typically centers on Mario (and sometimes his brother Luigi) navigating themed levels in the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Peach from the antagonist Bowser.

## Core gameplay

- Genre: Platformer (2D side-scrolling and 3D exploration entries).
- Core mechanics: run, jump, stomp enemies, collect coins/items, reach a level exit within a time limit (in many 2D titles).
- Two broad 3D approaches: open-ended exploration (e.g., *Super Mario 64*, *Sunshine*, *Odyssey*) and more linear, path-focused 3D games (e.g., *Galaxy*, *3D Land*).

## Playable characters

- Primary: Mario (often playable alongside Luigi).
- Other playable characters that appear across titles: Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Toads, Yoshi, Rosalina, Nabbit, and others.

## Power-ups & transformations

- **Super Mushroom:** increases character size and durability.
- **Fire Flower / Ice Flower / Gold Flower:** grant projectile or special abilities.
- **Suit-based power-ups:** examples include Raccoon/Tanooki suits (flight), Frog/Penguin/ Cat suits, Bee Suit, Mega/Mini variants, and more.
- Many power-ups alter movement, attack options, or interaction with the environment.

## Notable titles & releases

- **First release:** *Super Mario Bros.* (NES) — September 13, 1985.
- **Latest major release (as of this document):** *Super Mario Bros. Wonder* — October 20, 2023.
- The series has appeared on every major Nintendo console and on a small number of non‑Nintendo platforms.

## Development & history (brief)

- The series began in the 1980s and established many core platforming concepts and recurring elements (power-ups, themed levels, boss fights, overworld maps).
- Over time the series evolved from 2D side‑scrollers to experimentation with 3D open worlds and then a mixture of 2D revivals and modern 3D design.

## Reception & impact

- The Super Mario series is one of the best‑selling video‑game series of all time and is central to the broader Mario franchise.
- The franchise has had strong cultural impact across games, television, film, merchandise, and more.

## Assets & notes for implementation (for Claude Code)

> The following are suggested sections and assets that Claude Code may expect when using this markdown file:

- **Metadata block** (optional): title, platforms, release dates, designer, composer.
- **Sprites / art:** folders for characters, enemies, tilesets, power-ups.
- **Levels:** brief descriptions for example 2D and 3D levels (start, mid, boss), and sample JSON or CSV layouts.
- **Mechanics checklist:** run/jump physics, gravity, collision rules, enemy behavior, item pickup rules, checkpoint system, lives/extra lives rules.
- **Controls mapping:** keyboard, gamepad (move, jump, run, use power-up, pause).
- **License & assets:** clearly mark which assets are placeholders and must be replaced or licensed for distribution.

## Suggested markdown structure for Claude Code consumption

1. `## Metadata` — basic metadata + resources
2. `## Gameplay` — mechanics, collisions, physics constants
3. `## Entities` — player, enemies, items, power-ups (with behavior descriptions)
4. `## Levels` — folder structure and example level definition(s)
5. `## Assets` — list of art/sound placeholders, naming conventions
6. `## Build / Run` — instructions for running prototypes (local server, engine commands)
7. `## References` — note pointing back to the original source (Wikipedia)
